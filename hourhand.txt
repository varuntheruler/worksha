ANGLE BETWEEN HOUR HAND AND MINUTE HAND

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:

       This problem is known as clock angle problem.
where we need to find angle between handsof an analog
clock at a given time.
       here user should provide input of hour and minute.
and angle between them is found by tking reference to 12:00.

ALGOITHM:
      
      Firstly calculate the angle made by hour hand with 
respect to 12:00 in h hours and m minutes.
      Secondly Calculate the angle made by minute hand with respect
to 12:00 in h hours and m minutes.
      The difference between two angles is the difference between
two hands.


SOURCE CODE:

def calc_angle(h,m):
    if(h<0 or m<0 or h>12 or m>60):
        print("wrong input")
    if (h==12):
        h=0
    if (m==60):
        m=0
    hour_angle = 0.5*(h*60+m)
    minute_angle= 6*m

    angle = abs(hour_angle-minute_angle)
    mangle = min(360-angle,angle)
    return angle
h = int(input("enter h value"))
m = int(input("enter m value"))
print(calc_angle(h,m))

INPUT:
     enter h value=3
     enter m value=30

OUTPUT:
    75.0

EXPLANATION:
      
        The minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes (6 degrees in 1 min)
and the hours hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours(0.5 degrees in 1 min).
     In h hours and m minutes, the minute hand would move(h*60+m)*6
and hour hand would move (h*60+m)*0.5.
       therfore,as h = 3 and m = 30
                   abs((3*60+30)*0.5)-((3*60+30)*6))=75.0 degrees
   i.e..,the angle between hour and minute hand is 75.0 degrees.

TIME COMPLEXITY:

      The time complexity for above programme is O(1).
